Every Who      
 Down in Who-ville     
 Liked Christmas a lot…     
      
But the Grinch,     
 Who lived just North of Who-ville,      
 Did NOT!      

The Grinch hated Christmas! The whole Christmas season! Now, please don’t ask why. No one quite  knows the reason. It could be that his head wasn’t screwed on quite right. It could be,   
perhaps,that his shoes were too tight. But I think that the most likely reason of all         
 May have been that his heart was two sizes too small.
